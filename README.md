Cipher Tool with Tkinter GUI

This project is a Python-based encryption and encoding tool that provides an interactive Tkinter GUI for experimenting with different cryptographic techniques. It supports classic ciphers and modern encoding schemes, allowing users to encrypt, decrypt, encode, and decode text easily.

Features

Caesar Cipher

Shift-based substitution cipher

Supports both encryption and decryption

Vigenère Cipher

Keyword-based polyalphabetic cipher

Encrypts and decrypts text using a given key

Base64 Encoding/Decoding

Encode plain text into Base64

Decode Base64 back into readable text

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Built with Tkinter for simplicity

User-friendly interface to input text, select cipher, and view results

How It Works

Select the desired cipher/encoding method from the GUI.

Enter the input text and required parameters (e.g., shift for Caesar, key for Vigenère).

Click the Encrypt/Decrypt/Encode/Decode button.

The result is displayed in the output box, with an option to copy it.
